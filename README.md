# linearize-dynamics
Experiment code for my senior thesis, "A Deep Learning Approach to Modeling Nonlinear and Chaotic Dynamics with Memory"

Included is the Jupyter notebook used to test and run the code. Code is written in Numpy and PyTorch.

Inside one of the blocks is a collection of all nn.Module classes for the neural network architectures proposed in the thesis.
