# linearize-dynamics
Experiment code for my senior thesis, "Integrating Deep Learning with the Theory of Nonlinear, Chaotic, and History-Dependent Dynamics"

Included is the Jupyter notebook used to test and run the code. Code is written in Numpy and PyTorch.

Inside one of the blocks is a collection of all nn.Module classes for the neural network architectures proposed in the thesis.
